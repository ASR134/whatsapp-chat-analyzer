## 🎨 Design

ChatPulse uses a custom dark UI built entirely with Streamlit's `st.markdown` and injected CSS:

- **Fonts** — Syne (headings) · DM Sans (body) · Space Mono (data/mono)
- **Palette** — Deep `#07080d` base with atmospheric purple/teal/pink radial gradients
- **Charts** — Unified dark matplotlib theme with gradient accent bars and glow line plots
- **Cards** — Glassmorphic stat cards with per-card gradient accents and hover effects
